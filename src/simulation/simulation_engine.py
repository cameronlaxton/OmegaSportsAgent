"""
Simulation Engine Module

Runs Monte Carlo simulations for team markets (spreads, totals, ML) and player props,
dispatching to sport-archetype-specific models.

Architecture: Engine is input-driven only. No network calls. Callers must supply
home_context, away_context (and for player props: game_context, player_context).

Sport archetypes:
    basketball        - ORtg/DRtg/pace possession model (Normal)
    american_football - Points/drives efficiency model (Normal)
    baseball          - Run environment model (Poisson), pitcher-aware
    hockey            - Goal/shot model with goalie (Poisson), regulation draw
    soccer            - Goal model (Poisson), 3-way result
    tennis            - Point-level probability, best-of-N sets (Bernoulli)
    golf              - Field probability, strokes-gained model (Normal)
    fighting          - Win probability + method-of-victory (Bernoulli)
    esports           - Map win probability, best-of-N (Bernoulli)
