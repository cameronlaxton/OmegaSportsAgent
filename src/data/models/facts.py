Canonical data structures for the search-first data pipeline.

These are pipeline-internal types used between stages (acquisition → extraction →
normalization → validation → fusion → orchestration). They are distinct from
agent/models.py contracts (GatherSlot, ProviderResult, GatheredFact) which define
the interface between the agent layer and the data layer.
